# Automatic-Detection-Of-Pathological-Myopia-And-High-Myopia-From-Fundus-Images
This project focuses on developing an automated system to detect and classify Pathological Myopia and High Myopia from fundus images using deep learning techniques . 
The system analyzes retinal images to identify and differentiate normal, high, and pathological myopic conditions. Early and accurate detection can significantly help in timely interventions and improve eye health outcomes.

Objectives
Advanced Image Preprocessing: Standardize image quality, correct distortions, enhance features, and reduce noise.
Feature Extraction: Identify key characteristics such as optic disc parameters, retinal thickness, and blood vessel patterns.
Deep Learning Implementation: Train and optimize CNN models for feature analysis and classification.
User-Friendly Interface: Develop an intuitive interface for healthcare professionals.
System Optimization: Ensure the system is efficient, reliable, and accurate.

Programming Language: Python
Libraries & Frameworks: TensorFlow, Keras. 
Models: Deep learning models(CNN,DenseNet,VGG)
Tools: Streamlit (for interface development)
